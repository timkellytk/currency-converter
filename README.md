## Suggested Improvements

If provided more time, I would make the following improvements:

- Style the dropdown icon as shown in OFX's screenshots
- Create a mask for the `Amount` to separate the number on thousands (e.g. 25,000.00)
- Refactor state form logic using the [formik](https://formik.org/) library
- Get all the quote requests saved to a databas
